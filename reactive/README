Please under no circumstances change the file Manifest.txt. If you do then
I will not be able to run your program without additional tweaking. If
your directory structure is not the same as mine then you will not be
able to run the jar file. This is perfectly normal behaviour.

The most straightforward approach is to implement code in the
subdirectory of the src directory. Please note there are some skeleton
files already there. The .xml files provided in config directory are
configured to look for the behaviors of your agents in these
classes. For the simplicity sake, each .java file must have
corresponding .class file in the same directory (in other words the
program must be compiled and available in src directory).

If you want to run your program on your system which has a different
directory structure then classpath variable should point to directory
LogistPlatform/bin (or logist.jar), LogistPlatform/lib/jdom.jar,
LogistPlatform/lib/commons-math-1.1.jar, RepastJ/repast.jar

Compilation Example :

javac -sourcepath ./src -cp ../../../LogistPlatform/bin/:../../../LogistPlatform/lib/jdom.jar:../../../../Repast-3.1/RepastJ/repast.jar:../../../LogistPlatform/lib/commons-math-1.1.jar src/org/logist/reactive/ReactiveBehavior.java 

Note : repast.jar uses internally jar files from RepastJ directory,
copying repast to other directory (.e.g. LogistPlatform/lib/) and
attempting to set the classpath to the file there will cause problems
as it will not be able to find some of its own external jar files.

Run Example :

java -cp ../../../LogistPlatform/bin/:../../../LogistPlatform/lib/jdom.jar:../../../../Repast-3.1/RepastJ/repast.jar:../../../LogistPlatform/lib/commons-math-1.1.jar:. MainReactive


Note : Please notice that CLASSPATH (cp) is augmented with path "." as it needs
to find precompiled MainReactive.class file.

Due to possible usage of different versions of JVM it is advised to recompile 
the MainReactive.java class file.



Directory structure to make your jar file work (given fixed! manifest) :

CourseIntelligentAgents/Repast-3.1 - with Repast
CourseIntelligentAgents/LogistPlatform/LogistPlatform - with LogistPlatform
CourseIntelligentAgents/LogistPlatform/Assignments/reactive/lastname/ - with the files you have received for reactive Agent exercise plus your own code.

In order to submit the solution, simply run the script pack.sh with
your lastnames (e.g. Boi-Szymanek) while being in the same directory as 
script pack.sh . 



Tips for Eclipse users : 


Choose path to Assignments/reactive as your workspace. Create a project named
lastname. Add all neccessary jar files, logist.jar, repast.jar, colt.jar, trove.jar, 
jdom.jar, commons-math-1.1.jar, and log4j-1.2.15.jar to your build path as external jar
files. Now, you should be able to change skeleton files in src directory and run the
example by executing the MainRabbit.java program.
